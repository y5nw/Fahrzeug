This is the source code for a school project back in 2021. The VCS
information has been reset because I used my school email address
back then and do not want to reveal such information.

The project was essentially about making a "car"
- move forward without turning left or right,
- stop at some distance in front of an obstacle, and
- move backward if the obstacle moves toward the car.

As an additional feature, I implemented some basic controls over the
serial port. Considering that this is a school project (and that I
have, in my opinion, documented the code quite well, albeit in German),
figuring out and extending the control system is left an exercise for
the reader.
